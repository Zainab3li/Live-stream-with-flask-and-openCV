In this task, I created a live stream using a flask and OpenCV. At the end of this CO-OP, I will use this task with a robot that detects the faces of the people who will be attending the final party. I learned new skills that how can I use OpenCV and flask library and how I can create a live stream. In the future when I will create a program or website that requires face recognition or body or anything else I will not consume a lot of time to do this task because I learned the basics that will help me to do it.
